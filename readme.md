# why
I previously came across [glowcoil's blog](https://glowcoil.com/) and admired its simple and elegant style. However, on August 8, 2023, I noticed that the style had been redesigned. To preserve the old style, I forked the repository and added build scripts. Screenshots of the original style are shown below. If you prefer the old design, you can switch to the [old_theme](https://github.com/zhangziang/glowcoil_site/tree/old_theme) branch to view it.
