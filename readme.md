# why
I saw [glowcoil's blog](https://glowcoil.com/) before, the style was very simple and elegant. But recently (August 8, 2023), I noticed the style has been redesigned, so I forked this repo to preserve the old style and add build scripts. Screenshots of the old style are shown below. If you like it too, you can switch to the [old_theme](https://github.com/zhangziang/glowcoil_site/tree/old_theme) branch to view it.
